# Getting started

### General

```dart
void main() {
    print('Hello World');
}
```

The above code will print \"Hello World\" to the console when run.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- [x] The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It's where execution begins.
- [ ] - `print('Hello World')` prints \"Hello World\" to the console. The `print()` function is a built-in function in Dart that outputs data to the console.

- [ ] _Everything_ will work fine if **these** ~~instructions~~ are followed.

### Testing

You can run this code by creating a new Dart file (e.g., `hello_world.dart`) and pasting the code into it. Then, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the following command:

```dart
hello_world.dart
```

### Running

This will compile and run the Dart program, and you should see \"Hello World\" printed to the console. Know more: www.google.com
